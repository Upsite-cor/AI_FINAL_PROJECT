1. **Import Libraries**
   - `numpy`: A popular library for numerical operations.
   - `matplotlib.pyplot`: Used for plotting graphs.

2. **Setting Constants and Seeding**
   - `np.random.seed(7)`: Ensures reproducibility by setting a fixed starting point for random number generation.
   - `LEARNING_RATE`: Determines how much to update the network's weights during training.
   - `EPOCHS`: Number of times the entire training dataset will be passed through the network.

3. **Function Definitions**
   - `read_data()`: Reads data from a file, shuffles it, and selects a portion for training.
   - `layer_w(neuron_count, input_count)`: Initializes the weights of a neural network layer.
   - `sigmoid(x)`: The sigmoid function, used as an activation function in the network.

4. **Network Structure Initialization**
   - Sets up the weights, outputs, and error terms for the hidden and output layers of the neural network.

5. **Training and Testing Data Preparation**
   - Prepares variables for plotting and managing data during training and testing.

6. **Network Operation Functions**
   - `show_learning(...)`: Records and prints out the training progress.
   - `plot_learning(chart_y_test)`: Plots the learning curve of the network.
   - `forward_pass(x)`: Computes the output of the network for a given input.
   - `backward_pass(y_truth)`: Adjusts the network's errors based on the difference between predicted and actual output.
   - `adjust_weights(x)`: Updates the network's weights based on the errors.

7. **Training Loop**
   - Iterates through the dataset multiple times (epochs), each time updating the network's weights based on the data.
   - After each epoch, the training and testing errors are calculated and recorded.

8. **Early Stopping and Final Weights Saving**
   - The training process can stop early if there's no improvement in test loss after a certain number of epochs (determined by `PATIENCE`).
   - At the end of training, or on early stopping, the final weights of the network are saved to a file.

9. **Plotting the Learning Curve**
   - Finally, the training and testing errors across epochs are plotted to visualize the learning progress of the network.

In essence, this code trains a neural network to learn from a given dataset. It adjusts the network's weights based on errors in its predictions, continuously improving its performance. The training process is monitored and can be stopped early if no further improvement is seen, and the results (in terms of learning curves and final weights) are saved and plotted for analysis.
